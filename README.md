# SportsClo [WIP 75%]

An ecommerce shopping application for a made up sports store made using JS, Next JS, React, Redux/Toolkit, Mongoose ORM and MongoDB.

## Functions

- Landing page to display promotions
- Cart
- Promo/discount codes
- Adding different variations of items
- Search for items
- Auth (not really necessary as not a real store)
- Filtering in categories [WIP]

## Notes/Considerations

- Almost complete but I've discontinued working on it for the time being as I've switched to using typescript, might finish it up in the future.
- Images on the landing page with the carousel should be preloaded as its leads to janky animations at the moment.
- Add filtering section
- Add feedback/notifs when adding/removing items to cart
